# NEATpy
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm implementation in Python

Created as a personal challenge for HackUVIC 2018 Hackathon.

Going to try to beat the OpenAI walking Biped challenge using genetic optimization of Artificial Neural Networks, more specifically the NEAT algorithm.

## Challenge:

Create a system for genetic optimization of neural networks using the NEAT algorithm which can learn to walk given the simple 2D biped model from the openAI gym.
